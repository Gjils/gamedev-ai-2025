## Why We Chose These Technologies:

### GigaChat AI Model
We use GigaChat MAX because it's a powerful Russian-language AI model. It gives us high-quality answers in Russian and understands our needs better than foreign models. Since our project is for Russian users, this is the perfect choice.

### Solid.js for Frontend
Solid.js is a very fast JavaScript framework. It helps us show complex game objects and visualizations smoothly without slowing down. Its simple code structure makes development easier too.

### FastAPI for Backend
FastAPI is a modern Python framework that's both fast and easy to use. It helps our server communicate quickly with the frontend and AI model. The automatic documentation saves us lots of time.

### Docker for Deployment
Docker packages our app with all its dependencies into containers. This means:
It runs the same way on all computers
Easy to share with teammates
Simple to deploy on servers
No "but it works on my machine" problems
